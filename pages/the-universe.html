        The word "Universo" derives from the Latin "universum." The Latin word was used by Cicero and later by other authors with the same meaning as it is employed today. The Latin word is derived from the poetic contraction "unvorsum"—first used by Lucretius in Book IV of his "On the Nature of Things"—which connects "un" or "uni" (one) with "vorsum" or "versum" (meaning "something turned, rolled, or changed").
